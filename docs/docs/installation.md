## Linux

1. Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/theluqmn/falcon/releases) and download the `falcon` binary.
2. Run `chmod +x falcon` to make the file executable.
3. Run `./falcon` to start the server.

## Windows

You will need to use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run Falcon on Windows, or build the project from source (I do not have time to test this).
